# 1.0 Business Case
A university is looking to improve student, faculty, and administrative access to institutional data such as course schedules, deadlines, and announcements. As of right now, students must navigate through multiple disconnected systems, such as LMS, registration, email and calendars. This leads to inefficiency, missed deadlines, and redundant communication.

Objective: Build an AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform that offers a more synchronized and unified conversational interface for these services using text or voice. It integrates with the existing systems to deliver personalized contextual answers.

Key benefits:
- Students: Simplified access to academic information, personalized dashboards, dynamic notifications.
- Lecturers: Ease of publication of materials (notes, presentations, files), automated reminders, class analytics
- Administrators: Concentrated policy control, monitoring, campus wide announcements
- System Maintainer: Streamlined deployment pipelines, real time monitoring, easy configuration of AI models and APIs
- Data Source Systems: Standardized API integrations, consistent synchronization, and reduced data redundancy across LMS, registration, calendar, and email services

Challenges:  Integration complexity, privacy compliance, AI accuracy, and scalability
